# Placement Information System using MERN Stack

Front-end- React.js

Web framework- Express.js

Web server- Node.js

Database- MongoDB

### With this project, the entire Placement Information broadcasting process can be concentrated in a single web application.This could be helpful for the students since they would be able to review this information as and when they wish instead of looking through piles of emails. This portal can enable the reduction of most of the manual work for the Placement Cell administration. All the students would be able to gather their information faster . This will also increase the speed at which students can apply to these placement drives.
